# EOMSolver
`EOMSolver` is a python package for solving the equations of motion governing fast flavor evolution of a dense neutrino gas. Please see `1DBoxsolver.py` and `2DBoxsolver.py` for more details.

`1DBoxsolver.py` : Solves Eq. (3.2.1) in the thesis as a function of time. 

`2DBoxsolver.py` : Solves Eq. (4.3.1) in the thesis as a function of time. 

`EOMSolver` requires `Intelpython` and the recent `SciPy` and `NumPy` libraries.
